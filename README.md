# Laravel Nova

> This is a [Vemto](https://vemto.app) plugin. Vemto is a GUI [Laravel](https://laravel.com) generator with a complete set of tools for starting new [Laravel](https://laravel.com) projects. 

This plugin aims to bring the generation of [Laravel Nova Resources](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/resources/) to your Vemto Laravel project.

> **Note:** this plugin doesn't install Laravel Nova, as it is a paid package. Before using it, please be sure to follow all [Laravel Nova installation steps](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/installation.html)

# How it works?

Within the configuration page, you only need to select the CRUDs that will be generated as a *Laravel Nova Resource*.

You will also have the option to choose to generate:

- Specific CRUDs
- Inputs
- Specific relationships from the crud model
